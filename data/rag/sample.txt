Edge Conversational Agent is a local pipeline that turns speech into answers and back into speech.

The pipeline steps are: ASR (Whisper) turns audio into text. RAG retrieves relevant documents. The LLM (e.g. Ollama) generates an answer from context and the question. TTS (e.g. Piper) turns the answer into audio.

You can measure end-to-end latency to simulate an edge device. Use MOCK_EDGE=1 to limit threads.
